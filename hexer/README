Homework 4

I e-mailed Glen about being sick this week but never got a response.  If I must
get a health center note, that's fine.

The test vector generator assumes the file without test vectors is named
'hexer.abl' (if there are test vectors, they are overwritten).  The output
file with test vectors is named 'hexer_w_vecs.abl'.
