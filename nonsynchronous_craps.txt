This is not synchronous because the chips that lead to the outputs (LEDs and 
segment display) do not run on the same clock, let alone a clock at all.  Thus,
the two die and display won't necessarily update at the same time.
Additionally, because there is no clocking of inputs, they are susceptible to
glitches, so it's feasible that the die and display tempporarily receive/display
the wrong data.
