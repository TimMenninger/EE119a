For whatever reason, no software I've tried to download has worked for me.
The only way I've been able to test was with timing simulations in Quartus,
but haven't been able to run any test bench files.  That said, my solutions
seem to be correct, but if they don't run with the test benches, let me know
and when I come back on Saturday, I'll fix them when I can use the machines in
Moore.  The issue is likely something with nomenclature.

Notes:
RLLEncoder: Without running the tests, I don't know if this is correct.  But
from reading the test bench, it looks like it assumes the first output bit
lags the first input bit by 5 clocks.  My solution only lagged by four clocks.
The hard copy is this 4-clock-delayed solution, but I submitted both that
file as well as an identical file with a dummy wait flag when START goes
active.  This causes a fifth bit lag.  This is in the RLLEnc5.vhd file.

SerialMultiplier: I wrote a test bench the way I would have if I were testing,
but I haven't run it for aforementioned reasons.
