This directory contains the elevator abel code to convert a "1" to a ground
symbol.  Also contained in this directory is code that creates, inserts or
removes test vectors from .abl files (or any file, if they have the right
format).

Contents:
elevator.abl - The ABEL code for the elevator assignment.
extra_credit.txt - Contains answer to extra credit question regarding
    implementation with no clock.
floor_patterns.py - Contains light patterns for each floor
generate_elevator_tests.py - Creates test vectors for the elevator and inserts
    them into the argued file.  It takes one argument: the relative path to the
    file in which test vectors are to be inserted.  If this comes across a line
    containing 'TEST_VECTORS' (case insensitive), it will remove all lines after
    it and before the line containing 'END' or the end of the file.  This
    functionality has not been well tested on erroneous inputs.
    usage: python generate_elevator_tests.py [filename]
remove_test_vectors.py - Removes test vectors from a file by removing all lines
    after (and including) one that begins 'TEST_VECTORS' (case insensitive, if 
    it exists) and before a line that begins 'END' (or the end of the file).
    This has not been tested well on erroneous inputs.  This will remove from
    all argued files.
    usage: python remove_test_vectors.py [filename1 ...]
test_vectors.py - Helper functions for generate_elevator_tests.py and
    remove_test_vectors.py
