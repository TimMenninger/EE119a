# on_floor
#
# Generates test vectors as if it is on the floor designated by the light_array
# argument.  It will start on the argued mux_row, and every clocks_per_row,
# it will go on to print a test vector for the next row.  This will run for
# num_clocks iterations.  This will alternate the value of chg between 0 and 1
# on each new row.  It assumes that the argued file is open and ready to be
# written to.  This runs for ceil(num_clocks / clocks_per_row) * clocks_per_row
# iterations so as to not mess up the chg input.
#
# Arguments: openfile (file) - The file to write test vectors to
#            light_array ([[int]]) - Designates the light patterns for each row
#               where each value is a 0 or a 1
#            mux_row (int) - The row to start on
#            num_clocks (int) - The number of clocks to run for
#            clocks_per_row (int) - The number of clocks spent displaying each
#               row
#            chg (bool) - The beginning value of chg (this is alternated
#               immediately)
# Returns:   mux_row (int) - The ending row being displayed
#            chg (bool) - The ending value of chg

    Simulates the elevator being on a particular floor (designated by the light
    array) for some number of clocks.  Outputs which row of mux it is on.
    The number of clocks per row determines at what frequency to change the
    row.  This will run for ceil(num_clocks / clocks_per_row) * clocks_per_row
    iterations.  If we are on the first floor, then we will detect that when
    the mux is on row 2.  At that point, we will begin displaying the ground
