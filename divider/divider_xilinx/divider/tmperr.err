INFO:Cpld - Inferring BUFG constraint for signal 'CLK' based upon the LOC
   constraint 'P9'. It is recommended that you declare this BUFG explicitedly in
   your design. Note that for certain device families the output of a BUFG
   constraint can not drive a gated clock, and the BUFG constraint will be
   ignored.
WARNING:Cpld:896 - Unable to map all desired signals into function block, FB3,
   because too many function block product terms are required. Buffering output
   signal HexDigits<3> to allow all signals assigned to this function block to
   be placed.
ERROR:Cpld:892 - Cannot place signal Dividend<15>. Consider reducing the
   collapsing input limit or the product term limit to prevent the fitter from
   creating high input and/or high product term functions.
ERROR:Cpld:868 - Cannot fit the design into any of the specified devices with
   the selected implementation options.
