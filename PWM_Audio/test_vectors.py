# int_to_binary_list
#
# Takes an integer and returns a list of 0s and 1s representing it in binary,
# with the 0th index containing the MSB.  If val requires more bits than
# num_bits, an error will rise.
#
# Arguments: val (int) - The number to convert
#            num_bits (int) - The number of bits in the result
# Returns:   binary_list (list) - The list of 0s and 1s with 0th index
#               containing the most significant bit

# binary_list_to_int
#
# Takes a list of 0s and 1s with the 0th index containing the MSB, and returns
# its integer equivalent.  The list is the binary representation of the int.
#
# Arguments: binary_list (list) - The binary representation of the number with
#               the 0th index containing MSB
# Returns:   out (int) - The integer representation of the binary list

# Arguments: lfsr (list) - Binary representation with 0th index containing MSB
#               of the current lfsr state.

# increment_counter
#
# Takes a bit list that represents a counter and increments it.  The
# distinction as counter is to imply that when the bit list is all 1s, it
# resets the counter to all 0s.
#
# Arguments: bit_list ([int]) - The counter to increment with the 0th index
#               containing the MSB
